    <h3>This is the <em>Finest</em> Vegetable Lasagna I Have <strong>EVER</strong> Tried!</h3>

    <p>One of my best friends is a vegetarian. She is also italian. If there's one thing that anyone knows, its that no one, <em><strong>NO ONE</strong></em>, does italian food better than an italian's mother. But we can't always get home easily, so I thought I would try to find a recipe that could make her feel like a little bit of her home was brought to her here.</p>

    <p>Now she might be a vegetarian, but I don't have time for these recipes that fill up their lasagna with strange fillers like corn husk, and rice dust, and the gently grated leftover nibblings of a field mouse feasting on a tablecloth at 2am...</p>

    <p>...so without further ado, I bring you: <em><strong>THE FINEST VEGETABLE LASAGNA RECIPE!</strong></em></p>
