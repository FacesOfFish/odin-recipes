        <li>1 bunch fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>1 siracha</li>
        <li>hoisin sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Place the rice noodles in a large heatproof bowl. Cover with warm water and soak for 20 minutes, until softened.</li>
        <li>While the noodles are soaking, heat a large pot over medium-high heat. Toast the black peppercorns, coriander seeds, and star anise pods for 2 minutes, until fragrant.</li>
        <li>While the seeds are toasting, peel the ginger and cut into pieces. Trim the ends off the green onions, then chop 5 inches off the bases and save the remaining green tops for later.</li>
        <li>Add the ginger and green onion bases to the pot and cook for 2 minutes, or until fragrant.
        </li>
        <li>Add the water, chicken broth, and chicken breasts. Increase the heat to high, cover, and bring to a simmer. Cook for 5 more minutes, then check the chicken every minute until cooked through. Remove from the heat.</li>
        <li>While the broth heats up, thinly slice the green onion tops. Cut the lime into wedges. Thinly slice the jalapeño.
        </li>
        <li>After 20 minutes of soaking, drain the rice noodles, then return to the bowl.</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken from the broth.</li>
        <li>Strain the broth over the noodles. Pour the noodles and broth back into the pot over high heat, then add the fish sauce. Cover and cook for 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Shred the chicken.</li>
        <li>Divide the noodles between four serving bowls and top with the shredded chicken, jalapeño, bean sprouts, and Thai basil. Ladle the hot pho broth over the noodles. Add a squeeze of lime, green onions, and any other favorite toppings.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
